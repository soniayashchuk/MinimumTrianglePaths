# Minimum Triangle Path

Solution for finding minimum path in the triangle.
Task:

*Write a command-line program that reads a text-format triangle from standard input and outputs a minimal path to the standard-
output as follows:
```
$ cat << EOF | scala MinTrianglePath*
> 7untitled
> 6 3
> 3 8 5
> 11 2 10 9
> EOF
> Minimal path is: 7 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 18*
```
